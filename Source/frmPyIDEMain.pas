            Bug fixes
 History:   v 1.2
            Updated the User Interface using Themes
            Messages History
            Previous/Next identifier reference (as in GExperts)
            Find Definition/Find references using BicycleRepairMan
            Find definition by clicking as in Delphi
            Reduced flicker on start and exit and somewhat on resizing**
            Converting line breaks (Windows, Unix, Mac)
            Detecting loading/saving UTF-8 encoded files
            Help file and context sensitive Help
            Check for updates

 History:   v 1.3
            Code completion in the editor (Press Ctrl+Space while or before typing a name)
            Parameter completion in the editor (Press Shift+Ctrl+Space)
            Find definition and find references independent of
              BicycleRepairMan and arguably faster and better
            Find definition by clicking works for imported modules and names
            Revamped Code Explorer Window featuring incremental search, properties,
              global variables, docstrings in hints etc.
            A new feature-rich Python code parser was developed for implementing the above
            Improved the Variable Windows
              shows interpreter globals when not debugging and Doc strings
            Improved code and parameter completion in the interactive interpreter
            Integrated regular expression tester
            Code and debugger hints
            Set the current directory to the path of the running script
            Added IDE option MaskFUPExceptions for resolving problems in importing Scipy
            Tested with FastMM4 for memory leaks etc. and fixed a couple of related bugs

            Note on Code and Parameter completion:
              The code and parameter completion should be one of the best you can
              find in any Python IDE.  However,if you find that code and parameter
              completion is not very accurate for certain modules and packages
              such as wxPython and scipy you can achieve near perfect completion
              if you add these packages to the IDE option "Special Packages"
              (comma separated text). By default it is set to "wx, scipy". Special
              packages are imported to the interpreter instead of scanning their
              source code.

 History:   v 1.5
          New Features
            Unit test integration (Automatic generation of tests, and testing GUI)

              users the option to mail the generated report

            Names in variables window are now sorted
            Allow only a single Instance of Pyscripter and open command line
              files of additional invocations at new tabs
            Interpreter window is now searchable
            Added option to File Explorer to browse the directory of the Active script
