**Before** using PyScripter, you must ensure that there is a version of Python 
greater or equal to 2.5 installed on your machine. If you do not have one 
installed, you can download one from http://www.python.org/.

Note: For compatibility with Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, this PyScripter version 
requires the latest C++ Redistributable Package.  This is automatically installed 
by Python 2.6 and Python 3.0.  If you do not have any of these versions installed, 
then you need to download and install it manually from

Also note that the 64-bit version of PyScripter (x64) works only on 64-bit Windows **and**
with 64-bit versions of Python.  The 32-bit version of PyScripter works on both
32-bit and 64-bit Windows with 32-bit versions of Python
