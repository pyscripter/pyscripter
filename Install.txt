Note: For compatibility with Python 2.6 and Python 3.0, this PyScripter version 
requires the latest C++ Redistributable Package.  This is automatically installed 
by Python 2.6 and Python 3.0.  If you do not have any of these versions installed, 
then you need to download and install it manually from

Also if you are using a 64bit version of Windows note that PyScripter will only work if a 32bit version of Python is installed.
